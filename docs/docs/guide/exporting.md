# Exporting

When your email is ready to send, you need to export the HTML code.

1. Click the **Export** button in the top right.
2. The **Export HTML** modal will appear.

## Options

- **Include Email Wrapper**: (Recommended) Keeps this checked to ensure your email looks good in Outlook and Gmail. It adds necessary code like `<!DOCTYPE>` and `<head>`.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Copies the code so you can paste it directly into Mailchimp or another tool.
- **Download HTML**: Saves a `.html` file to your computer.

## Using in Mailchimp

1. In Mailchimp, choose "Code your own" or "Paste in code".
2. Paste the HTML you copied from the editor.
