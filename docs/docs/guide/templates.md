   - _Note: This will replace your current content._

## Saving Your Work

### Workspaces

You can save your current email as a "Workspace" to come back to later.

1. Enter a name in the box at the top (e.g., "Monthly Newsletter").
2. Click **Save**.
3. To reload, click **Open** and select your saved workspace.

### Auto-Save

The editor automatically saves your work every few seconds to a draft, so you won't lose progress if you accidentally close the tab.
